First time poster but long time sufferer. I [25M] had a L5-S1 microdiscectomy and laminectomy  done to correct some numbness and weakness in my right leg after a football Injury that caused a herniation ten years ago. The surgery, overall, went very well! The surgeon did say that he was initially taken aback due to how destroyed the disc was. The recovery has been a bit of a rollercoaster. I was walking within a few hours after the surgery and was in minimal pain during the first three days besides at night. The second week was pretty tough mentally because I started having sciatica down both legs, and pretty bad at that. I called the doctors and they prescribed me some nerve calming medication which did wonders. The two weeks afterwards were amazing. The only symptom that I had was a slight numbness in my right pinky toe. I started waking a couple miles a day, cooking, bending a bit, and overall feeling great! My doctor said once I was off the pain pills, I could drive which was only a week and a half after surgery. \n\nUnfortunately, I slipped and fell forward four weeks after surgery. I got up and gathered myself but didn\u2019t feel and pain. I woke up the next morning and could tell I was a bit sore with minor sciatica. Two days later, I started work again which consists of sitting, standing, and walking around to hunt down people for 10 hours a day. During the course of the workday, I had some sciatica and notice standing for too long bothered me. Today has been the worst in awhile with a little more aggressive sciatica (3/10) and my nerves a bit more numb compared to how they were before the fall.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I just aggravated my back with the fall and it\u2019s a bit swollen or if I reherniated  it.

Just discovered this sub and wanted to talk a bit about my experience with back pain. Since I was around 16 years old, I\u2019ve had a very specific spot on my back that has progressively gotten more painful. It didn\u2019t come on suddenly, so bear with me here: at that age and in the following 1.5 years I had 3 visits to the emergency room for something that still hasn\u2019t been diagnosed. The first time, I woke up with severe menstrual type cramps that were concentrated just in my lower back. (It\u2019s right in between my \u2018back dimples\u2019 to be specific.) This felt odd because my period had ended the week before. I was fatigued, had tunnel vision and felt nauseous, and was in some of the worst pain of my life. We went to the ER &amp; found my heart rate spiked and blood pressure (might have been the opposite, can\u2019t remember) had dropped so severely I almost died. They ran nearly every test they could on me and found nothing. This happened two more times and since then the only thing that helps even a little with the pain is Naproxen. I\u2019ve seen doctors a few times since and have gotten nowhere with it. This week, it\u2019s so severe I\u2019ve been in tears multiple times (this isn\u2019t too unusual, but I\u2019m getting tired of it) and the meds aren\u2019t helping. If I move wrong, all my muscles seize up and I feel like I can\u2019t move. \n\nBased on all my research, signs are pointing to having endometriosis but I\u2019m not entirely sure. To this day I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a muscle that\u2019s hurting me or something deeper inside. It\u2019s in a weird spot that makes it really hard to tell. \n\nBut as the years go on it\u2019s been getting worse slowly, and I really don\u2019t know what questions I need to be asking to get somewhere with this.

Or potentially the l5-s1 disc being herniated and causing back pain? \n\nSo I\u2019ll try and make things simple but forgive me on length; \n\nHistory/Reason::::I\u2019m asking because after picking something up a year ago that was heavy and with terrible form and a jerk motion with the feeling of a burning pop/sharp pain in the lower back, I\u2019ve had to constantly battle pain that\u2019s just steadily spread from my very low back to both my legs/butt. Had to get a job with insurance and in August (9 months post injury) I was able to get an mri which showed that my my l5-S1 had been herniated. Doc didn\u2019t think it was worth immediately going to surgery and suggested shots and pt for 4-6 weeks to see if any of it would improve. I\u2019m now 2 shots down in the l5 left side, both feeling amazing while things were numbed but really just returned back to square 1 within 3-4 days. Both times my pain in the legs lessened around 90% and the back pain was almost entirely gone. But again, 3-4 days later I would wake up and just getting out of bed each day would feel like I was crawling back to where I was on the pain scale. Pt really didn\u2019t do much if I\u2019m being honest &amp; I tried guys. Being only 19, a healthy weight (skinnier but still healthy) I went in with a mindset of this could work if I give it 110%, but really all the things were the same stretches I read online during my time of obtaining insurance and I had already been doing (if my body could handle it, I never do anything that caused more pain) but the only thing different was machine workouts and an actual therapist pushing on my lumbar spine/hips but that same \u201chow did you feel after last appointment? How do you feel today?\u201d Type of questions always had the same answer.. \u201cwell it was pretty sore and flared up afterwards but after laying down, it\u2019s calmed down but it\u2019s really about the same as before\u201d.. so that\u2019s my history of what I\u2019ve been kind of dealing with (of course summed up A LOT but not trying to write a book) \n\nMy pain journey/described::::: now this is where I\u2019d like peoples experiences to compare too...so let\u2019s start when I first injured my back NOVEMBER 2019, I lifted a heavy object while bent over and jerked up, a literal pop (any common \u201cneck poppers\u201d out there have had a pop in their lifetime that\u2019s almost a warm feeling and feels very bad and unhealthy to be quite honest, that\u2019s what this was like) but a sharp knife stabbing kind of pain right in the lower left back added with it. I ended up leaving that job and enjoying the holidays before taking off in life (18 at the time) I noticed after playing my switch on my stomach soon after that job my back was still \u201csore\u201d but each time I got up it felt like a aching pain that felt left to the sacrum and almost in the upper left buttock. Thought nothing of it until a month later.. DECEMBER/JANUARY started running to get in better shape for military. Now after each run the pain was getting worse and worse. Went to the doctors freaking out because I didn\u2019t want to be disqualified from the military, they said it was more than likely muscular judging by where my pin point of pain was.. that low left buttock/back. \u201cStretch and keep running and you\u2019ll be fine\u201d... ha.. ha.. ha.. I believed it because ive been in fine shape really my whole life, never had ANY back issues before, everything eventually went away before in life...well come the day of leaving for the military, let\u2019s skip to the chase I couldn\u2019t leave and even though I wasn\u2019t disqualified then, I\u2019m 100% now disqualified. Now let\u2019s fast forward to February. My head was thrown in a loop, big life plan down the drain, no back up, and this dumb back issue.. got a job at FedEx for insurance, pain stayed the same for the time besides endurance, sitting in a car was getting worse, standing for too long was getting worse but stayed in the same area as far as I remember.... now APRIL/MAY, this is where my things got complicated. I started getting pains in my right leg and left, both \u201cpinging\u201d in the same places. The front quads above the knee running up the side of my hips up to my butt/back. I\u2019m going to assume this is nerve pain and will refer to it as such from here on.. I noticed this nerve pain would really be the worse when I was driving. After a hard work day, this pain felt so deep like it was in the center core of my legs.. but it\u2019s always just been pain, a throbbing just sharp pains, never weakness/numbness/tingling.. now AUGUST, I got the mri, showed the l5s1 herniated disc protruding on the left side.. my doc says I shouldn\u2019t feel anything on my right judging by the mri and thinks it could be fixed with pt because my back is definitely healthy other then that one thing (I\u2019d hope, I\u2019m 19)\n\nSo this is all kinda blurred to be honest, time is just flying and the medical process has me really just lost sometimes so forgive me the memory but let\u2019s move on to SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER.. my pain right now.. truthfully the more and more I bend forward and backward the less and less I can tell if my pain is actually more lumbar spine or if it\u2019s si joint area. But it\u2019s still that terrible terrible \u201cback pain\u201d when I bend any way, back/forth doesn\u2019t matter it all shoots pains, I can walk a good distance without much pain but still getting weird nerve like pains in my lower butt on and legs (both sides). Especially when in a car seat. I\u2019m just a little lost and don\u2019t want to jump the gun on surgery when I discuss it tomorrow with my doctor. I don\u2019t want to get a surgery on this l5-S1 if it\u2019s not the actual cause. My pain is so low on my back, definitely worse on the left then the right but for him to tell me that the herniated disc shouldn\u2019t do anything to my right side and me feel the pain I do, it creates doubt and anxiety. I want to be on the road to recovery, suicide/depression is a demon and one I\u2019ve already dealt with enough this year, thankfully my mother has stood beside me the entire time and really is the reason my feet stay planted on this planet. But I don\u2019t want any tricks when I\u2019ve spent my \u201cchildhood savings\u201d (16 years old working til now) on this microdisectomy. I don\u2019t want to get this surgery and a doctor shrug and go \u201cwell I guess it could be something else then\u201d after I recover from surgery and still feel the same if not worse... I will state my physical therapist did do quite a few \u201cphysical examination tests\u201d on me to see if it was the si joint and they did come up negative. None of the places he applied pressure really sparked that terrible pain but it\u2019s when I\u2019m laying in bed and bend in any way that pain just feels right below my spine and makes me doubt the lumbar area. I\u2019m not a doctor and haven\u2019t ever been through this so of course it could be the l5-s1 and it\u2019s just been injured for so long that it\u2019s impacted a hand full of nerves and I just feel pain lower in the back... \n\nI go to the doctors tomorrow to discuss this next step which is the surgery and I\u2019m going to request just one more mri before pulling the trigger on the surgery but I thought maybe reading some other experiences would put my mind at ease and maybe my \u201cabnormal\u201d pains aren\u2019t so uncommon among others who have had disc injuries for a while as well. It\u2019s also nice to just get all of this off my chest at times, thanks to anyone who gives the post a read and shares their time. I\u2019d love to hear your experiences/pains involving the lower discs or si joint. What flared your pain up? Did you know it was definitely a spine issue? What was your nerve pain like?
